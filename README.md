# minimalist-blog
A minimalist blog system in PHP, reading json files for posts. The goal is to have only what's needed for a blog and avoid time consuming plateforms like wordpress. Yes, it is time consuming to start from scratch too, but hey, I want to code a blog ok?! :)
No database, every post is in its own JSON files. 

You can read about the reason I developped it at http://www.dustanddonuts.com/post/2017012001/php-is-not-dead. That blog uses this framework btw!

The module for the newsletter is in python, and comes from another project that I coded some time ago.
