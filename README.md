# minimalist-blog
A minimalist blog system in PHP, reading json files for posts. The goal is to have only what's needed for a blog and avoid time consuming plateforms like wordpress. Yes, it is time consuming to start from scratch too, and won't be as optimized, but hey, I want to code a blog ok?! :)
